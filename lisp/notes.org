* Maintaining the dispatch table
  How do we ensure a consistent mapping between the dispatch table and
  the underlying state of the public wiki?

  The server could start up from a known previous state.  If there is
  no known previous state, it starts from scratch, which means that we
  simply have a known list of all mizar articles.
* Where does make enter the picture?
  It should enter at some point.  On the other hand, we might be able
  to implement a parallizable make-type thing, if we need to.
* URI planning
  - /public/abc: (X)HTML presentation of public ABC
  - /user/joeblow/my-notebook/text/abc: (X)HTML presentation of artice ABC (editabe only by user joeblow)
  - /stable/7.11.05-4.137.109/abc: (X)HTML presentations of stable ABC (not editable)
* Content negotiation?
  Different MIME types: HTML presentations (HTML 4, XHTML as HTML,
  XHTML as XML), miz representation.
