* TODO Set up some perl tests
  As things stand now, I am testing this code by doing a lot of manual
  changes.  Setting up perl tests would help to make this process more
  intelligent, and quicker, too.
* TODO Generate a JFM-like front page
  The post-commit hook seems like the right place to do that.
